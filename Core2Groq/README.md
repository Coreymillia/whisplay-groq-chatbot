# Core2Groq 📻🤖

Unified **M5Stack Core2** firmware that keeps the OTR radio project and now starts adding a **Groq chatbot mode** beside it.

The radio side still comes from [M5RadioStream](../M5RadioStream) (Core1 Basic), upgraded with **16-bit I2S audio** and an optional **SI4713 FM modulator** so the stream can be broadcast to any FM radio in the room.

Original concept: **[winRadio by Volos Projects](https://github.com/VolosR/WaveshareRadioStream)**

## Current controls

### Radio mode

Both the **on-screen touch footer** and **physical virtual buttons** work:

| Touch Zone | Button | Normal Mode | Settings Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| [SET] | BtnA (short) | Open sound settings | — |
| — | **BtnA (hold 1s)** | **Toggle FM ↔ Speaker output** | — |
| [STA] | BtnB | Cycle station (1.5s debounce) | Select next parameter |
| [VOL] | BtnC (short) | Cycle volume 0–10 (0=mute) | Increase value |
| — | **BtnC (hold 1s)** | **Toggle screen on/off** | — |
| [BACK] | BtnA | — | Exit settings |

> **FM badge** in header: green = FM mode active, grey = speaker mode active.
> RDS song title updates automatically on the receiving radio as each show changes.

### Bot mode

- Boots into **Bot mode** by default when a Groq key is configured
- bottom capacitive **REC** button records for the configured max time
- bottom capacitive **STOP** button stops an active recording
- bottom capacitive **HOLD** button records while held and stops on release
- on-screen **SET** opens the bot settings menu
- settings menu currently includes:
  - **Setup**
  - **Personality** preset cycling
  - **Model** cycling
- on-screen **RADIO** switches into radio mode
- on-screen **NEW** clears the current bot chat
- left side of the bot reply panel = scroll up
- right side of the bot reply panel = scroll down
- in radio mode, tap the **BOT** button in the header to return

## Hardware

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Board | M5Stack Core2 |
| MCU | ESP32 (dual-core, 240 MHz) |

## Optional SI4713 FM Modulator Wiring

The SI4713 is **fully optional** — the firmware detects it on I2C at boot and enables FM features automatically if present.

| CJMCU-4713 Pin | Core2 Connection | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VIN | 5V | Module has onboard 3.3V regulator |
| GND | GND | |
| SDA | GPIO21 (Port A) | |
| SCL | GPIO22 (Port A) | |
| RST | GPIO13 (expansion) | Required — library toggles it |
| LIN | GPIO26 (Port B) | ESP32 DAC2 analog audio |
| RIN | GPIO26 (Port B) | Same pin — mono |
| CS/SEN | Module's own 3V0 pin | Sets I2C address to 0x63 |
| ANT | ~2 inch wire (recommended) | See FCC disclaimer below — shorter is safer |
| GP1, GP2, 3V0 | Unconnected | Not needed |

**FM frequency** is set in the sound settings menu (FM MHz) and persists in NVS across reboots.

## Build & Flash

```bash
# Build and upload directly
pio run --target upload

# Serial monitor
pio device monitor --baud 115200
```

### Flash with M5Burner
Use **`Core2Groq_M5Core2-MERGED.bin`** — flash to offset `0x0`.

This merged image includes the bootloader, partitions, boot app, and the current Core2Groq firmware in one file.

## First Boot / Setup AP

On first boot (or hold **BtnA** during the 3-second splash), a captive portal opens:

1. Connect phone/PC to WiFi network **`Core2Groq_Setup`**
2. Open browser → `192.168.4.1`
3. Enter:
   - 2.4 GHz WiFi credentials
   - Groq API key for bot mode
   - default boot mode (**Bot** or **Radio**)
4. Save and reboot

Settings are stored in NVS and survive power cycles.

## Planned Features

- **FM passthrough / aux input mode** — stop the internet stream but leave the SI4713 modulator active, allowing an external MP3 player or audio source to be plugged in and broadcast over FM. Turns the Core2 into a general-purpose FM transmitter.

## ⚠️ FCC Disclaimer — FM Transmission Legal Notice

> **Read this before connecting an antenna to the SI4713 module.**

### Legal Status

In the United States, low-power FM transmission is governed by **47 CFR Part 15, Subpart D** (unlicensed intentional radiators). Under these rules:

- Transmission is permitted **without a license** only when the signal is so weak it cannot cause interference to licensed stations.
- The FCC does **not** define a specific wattage or distance limit — it defines an **interference threshold**. If your signal reaches a licensed station's coverage area and causes interference, you are in violation regardless of intent.
- The FCC **actively enforces** FM interference complaints. They use direction-finding equipment to locate illegal transmitters. Fines start in the thousands of dollars and equipment can be confiscated.

### Antenna Guidance

Antenna length dramatically affects range:

| Antenna | Approximate range | Risk level |
|---|---|---|
| No antenna (PCB trace only) | < 3 ft | Minimal |
| **~2 inch wire (recommended)** | **~10–15 ft** | **Safe for personal use** |
| 12 inch wire | ~30–50 ft | Use caution |
| 75 cm / 30 inch (λ/4) | ~80–150 ft | High — may leave your property |
| Full dipole or amplified | 300+ ft | Likely illegal — do not use |

**Recommendation:** Use a stub of 1–2 inches of wire. This is sufficient to fill a single room and keeps the signal well within your home. The SI4713 at full power with a proper quarter-wave antenna can reach 80+ feet even under non-ideal conditions — confirmed during testing of this project.

### Best Practices

1. **Keep the signal on your own property.** The signal should not be receivable from a public road, a neighbor's property, or anywhere you do not own or control.
2. **Choose an unused frequency.** Use the settings menu to pick an FM frequency with no existing licensed station in your area. Scan your local FM band before transmitting.
3. **Use the shortest practical antenna.** 2 inches is recommended. Longer = more range = more legal risk.
4. **Do not rebroadcast copyrighted content** beyond your own private use. The stations included in this firmware are Old Time Radio (public domain) content intended for personal, private listening only.
5. **This firmware is provided for educational and personal hobbyist use only.** The authors accept no responsibility for any regulatory violations resulting from its use.

> The FCC takes FM interference seriously. They will find you. Keep it short, keep it local, keep it legal.
